# I gotta a Socket, shellcode, porting, and coding book so ima look through it 
The book really goes over three programming Lingos:
    Cpp
    C
    Java
    C#, too

#this will be fun
#ngl java compiler be beating my ass
To be honest instead of Java I might try go
I think go could be a Security Lingo its like Py and C
For a good lingo for Security:
    Something that great at memory managment and,
    array bound checking
    buffer overflow attacks are almost impossible
    Wont be able to do pointer attacks
    Also something that keeps code in an enviorment
